# sergeilushtakbot

This is a Visual Studio 2017 project for a sample "banking" bot written as an exercise.

The bot understands three commands: "withdraw", "deposit", and "balance". 
It also understand two currencies: "dollars" and "pounds".

The commands can be formulated in a relatively free style, e.g., "deposit 400 dollars", "give me 44 bucks", "How much do I have", 
"in dollars", "put in 33 quid", "I would like my balance in pounds please", etc. 

The bot doesn't understand string format amounts (e.g., "forty four" instead of "44") - writing the conversion would not be too 
difficult plus the point of the execrcise was writing a "language understanding bot" that uses MS LUIS framework.

The bot is hosted in GitHub pages. The url is "sergeilushtak.github.io".
